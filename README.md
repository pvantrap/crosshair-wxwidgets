# wxWidgets OpenGL Crosshair Stress Test

This application is a minimal reproduction case designed to investigate a specific issue observed in **KiCad Eeschema** running on **Mutter 49.0** (Wayland).

## The Issue

In KiCad Eeschema, users have reported situations where the crosshair stops tracking the mouse, accompanied by the following warning in the compositor logs:

> "Frame has assigned frame counter but no frame drawn time"

This application attempts to reproduce this behavior by using a `wxGLCanvas` with a high-frequency timer to stress the rendering pipeline, mimicking the behavior of KiCad's canvas.

See https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/issues/26024

## Usage

Compile the application using `make`.

Run the application:

```bash
./crosshair_app [options]
```

### Command Line Options

*   `--diagnostics`: Enable detailed diagnostic logging to stdout (frame counts, swap buffer timing, etc.).
*   `--show-timer`: Display the elapsed time (in milliseconds) since launch in the window title bar.
*   `--help`, `-h`: Show the help message.
